# TestSuite

An example of Mocha, Blanket, RequireJS and Grunt working together for a complete
unit testing and code coverage solution.

## Setup & Running

To run this you need to have NodeJS with NPM installed. After cloning the repo
simply run `npm install` to get the dev dependencies and then `bower install` to
to load the front-end dependencies.

You can then access the tests in browser at:

```
http://yourserver.com/{install_path}/test
```

Or run the tests in grunt via `grunt tests`.
